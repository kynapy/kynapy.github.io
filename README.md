# Hey There!
## About Me 
<img src="images/kynapy.png" width="200px" align="left">

Hello! My name is Kiyan, and I'm currently in my final year in the National University of Singapore (NUS), studying Life Sciences with a second minor in Computer Sciences. I have always had an interest in Biology since young, and have always been good in using technology and devices, always solving IT issues for my friends and family. Funnily, I never knew there was something called "Computer Sciences" until my second year of university, when I had to take a compulsory CS module. It was that module which allowed me to discover my passion for CS, hence the second minor. I am always looking to learn new things, so advice is always welcome, be it for my projects or my career.

## FAQ
<b>Q: Why not a second major in CS? </b><br>
A: I actually have taken sufficient credits and fulfilled the requirements required for a second major in CS. However, due to certain administrative issues such as the late application (due to late awakening to my interest in CS) and the limited number of spaces offered by my university, I was unable to officially get the second major as part of my degree.

<b>Q: Are you still thinking of a career in the biomedical industry in the future? </b><br>
A: Currently, my aim is to break into the tech industry. However, I have also thought of careers which involve the use of both my expertise, such as computational biology.
